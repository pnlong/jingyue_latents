# README

For the [MuseTok](https://github.com/Yuer867/MuseTok) project, we consider three MIR tasks to check the music understanding ability of the learned latent tokens:

1. Emotion recognition on EMOPIA at the **sequence** level, comparing to [MIDI-BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05223).
2. Chord progression detection on POP909 at the **beat** level, comparing to [Jiang et al](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000078.pdf).
3. Melody classification on POP909 at the **note** level, comparing to [MIDI-BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05223).
