# README

For the tokenization project, we consider three MIR tasks to check the music understanding ability of the learned latent tokens:

1. Emotion recognition on EMOPIA in a **sequence** level, comparing to [MIDI-BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05223).
2. Chord progression detection on POP909 in a **beat** level, comparing to [Jiang et al](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000078.pdf).
3. Style classification on Pianist8 in a **sequence** level, comparing to [MIDI-BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05223).
